<h3> A little about me </h3>
<p>I grew up in the mountains of Idaho. I enjoy teaching, particularly at the introductory level and helping others to develop and interest in economics.</p>

<p>I thrive in interdisciplinary work and applying economics to problems previously outside of the field.</p>

<p>My research has led me to develop a variety of computing skills that I never expected but now find essential. I appreciate the challenge of working on big data projects.</p>

<p>In addition to economics I enjoy playing basketball and <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/econrocks"> chess</a>.</p>
