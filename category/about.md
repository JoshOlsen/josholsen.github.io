<h3> A little about me </h3>
I grew up in the mountains of Idaho. I enjoy teaching, particularly at the introductory level and helping others to develop and interest in economics.  

I thrive in interdisciplinary work and applying economics to problems previously outside of the field.

My research has led me to develop a variety of computing skills that I never expected but now find essential. I appreciate the challenge of working on big data projects.


In addition to economics I enjoy playing basketball and <a href='https://www.chess.com/member/econrocks'> chess</a>.
